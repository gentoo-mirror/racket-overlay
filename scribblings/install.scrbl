@section{Racket's ebuild changes}

"dev-scheme/racket" ebuild differs from the one used in official
Gentoo package repository in following ways:

@itemlist[
          @item{SLOT changed to "0/${PV}", ie: "0/8.1", "0/8.2", ...}
          @item{additions to "src_prepare" to correctly setup the build environment}
          @item{update the xdg databases if USE=X is used}
          @item{EAPI bumped up to 8}
          @item{reordering of some functions (not causing logic to change)}
          @item{configure options as a array}
          ]


@section{Helpers}

We use 2 helper packages: "racket-compiler" and "racket-where".
Both of those packages are used in the eclass and are essential to it's function.
Also, both of those packages include internally their own definitions of
ebuild phases that otherwise would not be possible to resolve correctly.

Racket-Compiler is used to compile a directory of racket source code
in the "racket_src_compile" racket.eclass function.

Racket-Where is used to in "racket_pkg_prerm" racket.eclass function to check
if a package is registered in the Racket package database files.
This is primarily helpful if we update Racket - we get a new package database,
but the package pulled for rebuild is still installed and will try to execute
it's "pkg_prerm". If it is not in the pkg database the removal will
of course fail. Thus we use "racket-where" to prevent that failure by
not removing that package when we don't need to.
