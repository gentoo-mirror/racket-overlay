;;; TODO:
;; - dependencies
;; - source
;; - output to file
;; It should be possible to create a dependency graph of all packages
;; maybe then it would be easier to determine correct dependencies and
;; which pkgs should be skipped
;; Also, because we have the whole pkg map we can check
;; if a pkg dependency belongs to a undesired set.
